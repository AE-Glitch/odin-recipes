        <h2>Scrambled Eggs</h2>
        <p>I gotta admit, Scrambled Eggs or any Eggs dish is my favorite.</p>
        <p>Great thing with this dish is its light and can be had with almost anything for breakfast, lunch or dare I say dinner.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>2 large free range eggs</li>
            <li>6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk</li>
            <li>a knob of butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency</li>
            <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</li>
            <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</li>
            <li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</li>
            <li>CGive a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</li>
        </ol>
