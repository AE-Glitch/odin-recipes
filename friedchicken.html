        <h2>Fried Chicken</h2>
        <p><cite>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have 
            been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The 
            breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. 
            Broiler chickens are most commonly used. </cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_chicken" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a></p>
